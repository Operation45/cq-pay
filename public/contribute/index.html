        <p>Civic Quarterly cares deeply about the interactions we facilitate between authors and their editors. We do not accept fully written drafts outright. Instead, Civic Quarterly chooses to work with contributors based on the potential we see in the articles or data visualizations they propose. </p>
        <p>After accepting an author&rsquo;s pitch, Civic Quarterly pair authors with source editors to collaborate throughout the writing process. Editors and writers will work together over a period of a few weeks to develop, hone and publish a piece. As we&rsquo;re a new publication, we are still developing our fee schedule but hope to pay authors $150 per contribution at time of publication.</p>
        <section>
          <h1>Questions</h1>
          <p>Please consider the following points before submitting a pitch to us. Our editorial staff will use these questions as we evaluate your pitch&rsquo;s relevance to our community.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>From what vantage point are you writing? Are you writing as a government official, a civic technologist, a designer, a developer, a researcher, a citizen? Establishing a clear voice helps readers follow your narrative. </li>
            <li>Who is your audience?  Are you writing for civic technologists, government officials or another group? Consider how your audience will understand your piece, and what they&rsquo;ll likely want take away from it.</li>
            <li>What is your level of experience with your chosen topic? Providing anecdotal evidence is fine, but actual experience is preferred. It&rsquo;s also worth identifying, within reason, relevant prior research that&rsquo;s been done on this topic.</li>
            <li>Does your article fit into any of <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1E4n9LVbIq75-UDrT35t7BZ7Sk95DTN5mRNrB7884A4s/edit" rel="nofollow">our categories</a>? (Note that our categories are still evolving, and pieces outside of this group are fine.)</li>
            <li>If this article addresses an ambiguity in governance, how might publicly available data or future research be brought to bear on that ambiguity? Consider devoting part of your article to the direction that you&rsquo;d like for governments to evolve.</li>
            <li>If this article raises a moral or ethical quandary, how might readers better understand the <em>entire</em> spectrum of opinions or positions that they might take on the issue?</li>
            <li>If this article concerns a technological interface to government, how might that interface be made <a href="https://medium.com/@lippytak/people-not-data-47434acb50a8" rel="nofollow">more humane</a>?</li>
            <li>If this article suggests a certain way of going about a process, what are that process&rsquo;s most salient aspects? What, if any, are the discrete steps that readers might take to reproduce your results (or produce similar results)? What, if any, are the interactions that readers might consider as a starting point?</li>
          </ul>

          <h1>Structure</h1>
          <p>The Civic Quarterly Journal is a new publication and our articles don&rsquo;t necessarily have a recurring structure. Nonetheless, we&rsquo;re confident that most articles will contain the following elements in the following order:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>[Lede + thesis]:</strong> An article&rsquo;s lede paragraph should grab the reader&rsquo;s attention. It should let her know what this article&rsquo;s about, how this article relates to her life, and how she might change or inform her approach to civic design going forward. The author&rsquo;s thesis—his premise—should be easily ascertained.</li>
            <li><strong>[Intro]:</strong> Following the lede, the author should summarize her argument&rsquo;s main points in order to better prepare the reader for what&rsquo;s to come. One of our editors likens this part of the article to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll" rel="nofollow">Matryoshka doll</a>: authors quickly disassemble their article in order to provide an overview before more thoroughly studying each part.</li>
            <li><strong>[Main points]:</strong> Main points comprise the body of the article. Here, authors discuss background, provide alternate perspectives and make arguments in support of his thesis.</li>
            <li><strong>[Next steps]:</strong> Articles are only as good as the conversation they inspire. Instead of conclusions, Civic Quarterly encourages authors to provide readers with &ldquo;next steps,&rdquo; suggestions, or discussion questions that will help readers critically address the ensuing conversation.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>

          <h1>Miscellany</h1>
          <p>In case everything above wasn&rsquo;t enough to whet your appetite, here are the some of the other metrics we&rsquo;re shooting for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Length.</strong> Most articles appearing on Civic Quarterly will likely range in length somewhere between 800 and 2,400 words. We&rsquo;re plenty flexible right now, though. Long-form pieces may be as long as 6,000 words, for example.</li>
            <li><strong>Point of view.</strong> As much as possible, we&rsquo;d like to stick to the first-person and third-person plural (&ldquo;we&rdquo; and &ldquo;they&rdquo;). Any narrative you tell about yourself should be in first person, but we tend to avoid second person (&ldquo;you&rdquo;) altogether as it creates an unnecessary boundary between the author and her reader.</li>
            <li><strong>Research.</strong> We expect authors to provide research in support of the theories they espouse. Please link to relevant articles if you are making a statement that someone else has also made. Better yet, provide your own data if your team has learned something through practice. We&rsquo;ll gladly host the data on Github in a publicly available repository.</li>
            <li><strong>Show, don&rsquo;t tell.</strong> Rather than telling the readers, (for example) &ldquo;research is important,&rdquo; we expect authors to lead by example. Tell a story about a recent research endeavor that made a difference during the course of your project.</li>
            <li><strong>No sales.</strong> Civic Quarterly is <em>not</em> the place to showcase your cool new product. It is, however, the place to share the thinking <em>behind</em> your product.</li>
            <li><strong>Originality.</strong> Unless otherwise agreed to beforehand, drafts submitted to Civic Quarterly must be original. The article they describe may not have been previously published elsewhere. </li>
            <li><strong>Legalese.</strong> Civic Quarterly supports the <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/" rel="nofollow">Indie Web Movement</a>. We encourage authors to publish their articles, in full or in part, on their own website. That said, by accepting money from Civic Quarterly in exchange for their article (see above), authors grant the publication a royalty-free license to publish their article both online and offline. Authors consent to their full article, extracts, samples or examples appearing in Civic Quarterly&rsquo;s sites, products, and services.</li>
          </ul>
